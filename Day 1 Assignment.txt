 1.What is a compiler?

Ans:Compiler is a computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in high level language int a set of machine language       instructions that can be understood by a digital computer's	  CPU.The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate       source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language to create an executable program.

	 A Java compiler is a program that takes the text file work of a developer and compiles it into a 
	platform-independent Java file. Java compilers include the Java Programming Language Compiler (javac), the GNU Compiler for Java         (GCJ), the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ECJ) and  Jikes.	

2.What is a interpreter?

    Java interpreter is a computer program (system software) that implements the JVM. It is responsible for reading and executing the          program. It is designed in such a way that it can read the source program and translate the source code instruction by instruction.
